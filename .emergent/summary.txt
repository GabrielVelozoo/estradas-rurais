The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive Rural Roads Registry application. Initially, it integrated a provided React component, enhanced its UI, and added features like advanced filters (municipality, road name, value), pagination, sorting, and CSV export. A key challenge was consistently fetching all 145 records from Google Sheets due to CORS and API query limitations, which was eventually resolved by implementing a FastAPI backend proxy. The UI was refined iteratively, addressing layout issues, formatting, and responsiveness, and incorporating user feedback for specific text and card additions. A significant feature implemented was a priority system for roads, involving complex data mapping and visual highlighting. This trajectory demonstrates robust problem-solving, meticulous debugging, and iterative refinement based on detailed user feedback, culminating in a highly functional and polished application. A new, major feature request for a complete login system was just initiated.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a web application to display and manage Estradas Rurais (Rural Roads) data sourced from a Google Sheet. The application is a full-stack React frontend with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB.

Initial component integration and enhancements:
*   Display road data (município, protocolo, prefeito, estado, descrição, valor) from Google Sheets in a searchable table.
*   Implement advanced filtering by municipality, road name (description), and value range.
*   Add pagination, sorting (alphabetical by municipality by default), and CSV export.
*   Ensure the application fetches all 145 records from the Google Sheet, resolving issues with partial data loading (initially only 57-63 records).
*   Correctly calculate and display the total value of roads (expected around R$ 601.849.453,88), excluding summary rows from the source data.
*   Improve UI/UX: make municipality names fully visible without requiring expansion, ensure descriptions are not cut off (with optional expansion), optimize table layout, and enhance overall design responsiveness and professionalism.
*   Remove the UF (State) column and the state search filter from the UI to simplify.
*   Add Relatórios and Pedidos de Maquinários cards to the home page with placeholder Em breve descriptions.

Priority system implementation:
*   Detect roads marked as PRIORIDADE from a specific column (G) in the Google Sheet.
*   Visually highlight priority roads (e.g., using a red background, border, or badge).
*   Add a toggle button to filter and display only priority roads.
*   Ensure that each municipality has only one road marked as PRIORIDADE in the data processing.
*   Include a button to print the currently displayed roads.

**New Feature Request (Login System)**:
*   Implement user authentication with username/email and password.
*   Admin-only user creation (no public registration).
*   Secure session management via HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Lax cookies with 7-day expiration.
*   Backend API endpoints: POST /auth/login, POST /auth/logout, GET /auth/me, POST /admin/users (admin-protected for creation), optional password reset.
*   Database:  collection with uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) (uuid),  (unique),  (optional),  (Argon2id/bcrypt),  ('admin'|'user'),  (bool), , .
*   Frontend login UI: Portal de Consultas style, email/user + password fields, login button, error messages.
*   Middleware/Guards for protected and admin routes.
*   Essential security: Rate limiting on login, HTTPS, CSRF token, HTTP headers.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend development with functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useRef).
- **FastAPI**: Backend REST API development, used for proxying external data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for the React frontend.
- **Google Sheets API v4**: External data source, accessed programmatically.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, a persistent challenge for frontend-direct external API calls.
- **Backend Proxy Pattern**: Using FastAPI to fetch data from Google Sheets API, bypassing frontend CORS.
- ****: Python library for asynchronous HTTP requests in the FastAPI backend.
- **Data Normalization**: Parsing and cleaning inconsistent data from Google Sheets (e.g., currency, empty cells, priority flags).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


- ****:
    - **Summary**: Implements the FastAPI server. It handles API requests, including a new  endpoint acting as a proxy to fetch data from the Google Sheets API.
    - **Changes**: Added a new route  that asynchronously fetches data from the Google Sheets API v4 using  for the range . This endpoint processes the raw JSON response and returns it to the frontend, bypassing CORS restrictions. Imports for  were added.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: The root React component defining the application's layout and routing using .
    - **Changes**: Integrated , , and  (which was the final name after previous renames) components, setting up routes for the home page () and the rural roads dashboard ().
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Displays the application's dashboard overview with several informational cards.
    - **Changes**: Modified to include cards for Estradas Rurais, Dados do Gov (previously Obras Publicas), Relatórios, and Pedidos de Maquinários. Descriptions for Dados do Gov and Pedidos de Maquinários were updated as requested. The Desenvolvido com Emergent footer was removed.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: The central component for the rural roads data, including data fetching, filtering, sorting, pagination, and CSV export. It also renders the main table and statistics.
    - **Changes**:
        - Replaced entirely with a more robust, user-provided React component  (which was then renamed ).
        - Updated data fetching to use the backend proxy endpoint () instead of direct Google Sheets API calls.
        - Implemented advanced filtering logic for municipality, road name (description), and value range. The state filter and the UF column were removed as per user request.
        - Integrated pagination, client-side sorting, and CSV export functionality.
        - Implemented a sophisticated priority detection system: fetches data from Google Sheets range , identifies the PRIORIDADE column dynamically, normalizes priority values, and ensures a single priority road per municipality.
        - Added visual highlighting (red background, border, badge) for priority roads and a toggle button to show only priorities.
        - Included a print functionality to generate reports.
        - Adjusted data parsing from the backend response to correctly map columns (município, protocolo, prefeito, descrição, valor) and handle missing/empty cells robustly.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: Provides site-wide navigation links.
    - **Changes**: Created to include links to the home page and the Estradas Rurais dashboard.
- ****:
    - **Summary**: A helper component to render individual rows within the  table, specifically managing the display of descriptions and priority indicators.
    - **Changes**: Created to manage the conditional rendering of the description field (expand/collapse) and apply specific styling (red background, badge) for priority roads. It also ensures the full municipality name is displayed.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement a complete user authentication and admin system as per the detailed requirements provided by the user. This involves creating a  collection in MongoDB, defining FastAPI endpoints for login/logout/user management, and developing the corresponding frontend UI.

<current_work>
The immediate previous work involved successfully finalizing the Estradas Rurais data dashboard. All user requirements for data fetching (145 records), correct value summation (R$ 601.849.453,88), advanced filtering (municipality, road name, value range), sorting, pagination, CSV export, a visually enhanced priority system, and a print function were implemented and verified. The UI was polished, responsive, and aligned with all specific layout requests (e.g., removing state filter/column, expanding municipality names, proper description display).

Following this completion, the user introduced a new, significant feature request: a comprehensive login and authentication system with an admin panel. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this new task and started the initial phase. The very last action taken was to state the intention to install the necessary dependencies for the backend, marking the beginning of the implementation for the new login system.
