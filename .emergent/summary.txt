The AI engineer successfully built and refined a Rural Roads Registry application, evolving it from a basic data display to a feature-rich platform. Initial work involved integrating a React component, enhancing UI with filters, pagination, sorting, CSV export, and a FastAPI backend proxy to overcome Google Sheets API limitations. A complex priority system for roads was also implemented.

Subsequently, a significant login/authentication system was introduced. This involved extensive backend development (FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT, bcrypt) and a corresponding React frontend UI, including an admin panel for user management. The engineer iteratively refined the UI based on user feedback, addressing design, text, and critical functionality like username-based login and optional email for user creation.

A complex phase involved implementing strict routing redirections, initially to the login page, then to the  dashboard, which required multiple iterations and debugging. The  display was also modified to show ESTADO instead of a detailed description.

The most recent work focuses on developing a comprehensive Pedidos de Maquinários page, which is currently undergoing a major refactor to support municipality-specific equipment requests and dynamic total calculations. The engineer is actively troubleshooting issues related to component rendering and consistent application of changes.

<product_requirements>
The application, Rural Roads Registry, displays and manages Google Sheet data for rural roads. Initially, it required a searchable, sortable, paginated table with advanced filters (municipality, road name, value), CSV export, correct total value calculation, and UI enhancements. A key feature was a priority system for roads, including visual highlighting and a toggle filter.

A major new feature request was a full user authentication system: username/email and password login, admin-only user creation (roles 'admin'|'user'), secure HttpOnly cookies, and FastAPI endpoints for auth/admin. The frontend needed a Portal de Consultas style login UI.

The latest request is to transform the Pedidos de Maquinários section into a modern, institutional page for municipalities. It requires: selecting municipalities from Paraná, inputting leadership, dynamically adding equipment from a fixed list with auto-summing for municipality subtotals and a global total. Additional features include search, edit/remove pedidos, PDF/XLSX export, optional observations, and an institutional design. The page and its link in the navbar need to replace the Dados do Gov position.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the refactoring and implementation of the Pedidos de Maquinários page according to the detailed requirements (municipality selector, leadership field, dynamic equipment list, auto-summation, export options, UI design).
-   Troubleshoot why the Pedidos de Maquinários page is not rendering correctly and why the navbar changes (e.g., Informações Gabinete) are not consistently applied.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate previous work involved extensively refactoring the  component to implement the municipality-based equipment request system. This included creating the structure for selecting a municipality, adding leadership, and managing a dynamic list of equipment with automatic total value calculations. The user also requested removing the green color from the Pedidos de Maquinários card on the home page, which was applied.

However, after these changes and a frontend restart, the application is still encountering issues. Specifically, screenshots indicate that the  page is not loading correctly when accessed directly or via navigation; instead, the Home page is displayed. Furthermore, the navbar text Portal Municipal (which should be Informações Gabinete) is reappearing, suggesting that some frontend changes are not being consistently applied or there's a caching/routing conflict. The AI engineer is currently in the process of diagnosing and troubleshooting these persistent rendering and application issues.
